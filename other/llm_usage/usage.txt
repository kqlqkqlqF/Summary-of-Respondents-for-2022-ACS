first sentence: specify the general area of the paper and encourage the reader. This paper, employed the dataset from 2022 ACS from IPUMS USA, used the ratio of number of respondent and number of docteral degree in carnifonia to estimate the number of respondents who get a doctoral degree for each state in US 2022, and analysized the difference between the estimated number of doctoral degree and the actual number of doctoral degree in each states. The result of analysis shows a big differences between the actual number and the estimation, mainly due to difference in distribution of education resources and population demographics across each state. and a fourth sentence about implications. Please complete and modify my abstract so it satisfy the following: first sentence: specify the general area of the paper and encourage the reader; second sentence: specify the dataset and methods at a general level; third sentence: specify the headline result; and a fourth sentence about implications. An abstract is included and appropriately pitched to a non-specialist audience. The abstract answers: 1) what was done, 2) what was found, and 3) why this matters (all at a high level). Likely four sentences. Abstract must make clear what we learn about the world because of this paper. All aspects of submission should be free of noticeable typos, spelling mistakes, and be grammatically correct. Prose should be coherent, concise, clear, and mature. Remove unnecessary words.

Making use of the codebook, how many respondents were there in each state (STATEICP) that had a doctoral degree as their highest educational attainment (EDUC)? (Hint: Make this a column in a tibble.) If I tell you that there were 391,171 respondents in California (STATEICP) across all levels of education, then can you please use the ratio estimators approach of Laplace to estimate the total number of respondents in each state i.e. take the ratio that you worked out for California and apply it to the rest of the states. (Hint: You can now work out the ratio between the number of respondents with doctoral degrees in a state and number of respondents in a state and then apply that ratio to your column of the number of respondents with a doctoral degree in each state.) Then compare it to the actual number of respondents in each state. Please submit a link to a GitHub repo that has a Quarto document and a PDF produced by that Quarto doc that has: Instructions on how to obtain the data. A brief overview of the ratio estimators approach. Your estimates and the actual number of respondents. Some explanation of why you think they are different.

This paper examines state-level population estimates using the 2022 American Community Survey (ACS) data from IPUMS USA. The study applies the ratio estimator method, using California's respondent data as a baseline, to estimate the total number of respondents across all states. Comparing these estimates with actual respondent counts revealed significant discrepancies, largely due to variations in population demographics and sampling distributions across states. These findings highlight the limitations of ratio-based estimations in contexts with diverse demographic and sampling characteristics.

please write an introduction for the paper based on the abstract and the following information: An introduction needs to be self-contained and convey everything that a reader needs to know. We are not writing a mystery story. Instead, we want to give away the most important points in the introduction. For a ten-to-fifteen-page paper, an introduction may be two or three paragraphs of main content. Hayot (2014, 90) says the goal of an introduction is to engage the reader, locate them in some discipline and background, and then tell them what happens in the rest of the paper. It should be completely reader-focused.

The introduction should set the scene and give the reader some background. For instance, we typically start a little broader. This provides some context to the paper. We then describe how the paper fits into that context, and give some high-level results, especially focused on the one key result that is the main part of the story. We provide more detail here than we provided in the abstract, but not the full extent. And we broadly discuss next steps in a sentence or two. Finally, we finish the introduction with an additional short final paragraph that highlights the structure of the paper.

As an example (with made-up details):

The UK Conservative Party has always done well in rural electorates. And the 2016 Brexit vote was no different with a significant difference in support between rural and urban areas. But even by the standard of rural support for conservative issues, support for “Vote Leave” was unusually strong with “Vote Leave” being most heavily supported in the East Midlands and the East of England, while the strongest support for “Remain” was in Greater London.

In this paper we look at why the performance of “Vote Leave” in the 2016 Brexit referendum was so correlated with rurality. We construct a model in which support for “Vote Leave” at a voting area level is explained by the number of farms in the area, the average internet connectivity, and the median age. We find that as the median age of an area increases, the likelihood that an area supported “Vote Leave” decreases by 14 percentage points. Future work could look at the effect of having a Conservative MP which would allow a more nuanced understanding of these effects.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the data, Section 3 discusses the model, Section 4 presents the results, and finally Section 5 discusses our findings and some weaknesses.

rubric: The introduction needs to be self-contained and tell the reader almost everything that they need to know. A reader should be able to only read the introduction and have an accurate picture of all the major aspects of the whole paper. It would be rare to include graphs or tables in the introduction. An introduction should close by telegraphing the structure of the paper. The introduction is self-contained and tells a reader everything they need to know including: 1) broader context to motivate; 2) some detail about what the paper is about; 3) a clear gap that needs to be filled; 4) what was done; 5) what was found; 6) why it is important; 7) the structure of the paper. A reader should be able to read only the introduction and know what was done, why, and what was found. Likely 3 or 4 paragraphs, or 10 per cent of total. All aspects of submission should be free of noticeable typos, spelling mistakes, and be grammatically correct. Prose should be coherent, concise, clear, and mature. Remove unnecessary words. Do not use the following words/phrases: 'advanced', 'all-encompassing', 'apt', 'backdrop', 'beg the question', 'bridge/s the/a gap', comprehensive', 'critical', 'crucial', 'data-driven', 'delve/s', 'drastic', 'drives forward', 'elucidate/ing', 'embark/s', 'exploration', 'fill that/the/a gap', 'fresh perspective/s', 'hidden factor/s', 'imperative', 'insights from', 'insight/s', 'interrogate', 'intricate', 'intriguing', 'key insights', 'kind of', 'leverage', 'meticulous/ly', 'multifaceted', 'novel', 'nuance', 'offers/ing crucial insight', 'plummeted', 'profound', 'rapidly', 'reveals', 'shed/s light', 'shocking', 'soared', 'unparalleled', 'unveiling', 'valuable', 'wanna'. The introduction is for the following paper: 1 Data Obtaining To obtain the data from IPUMS USA (Ruggles et al. 2024), follow these steps: First, open the IPUMS website and navigate to the IPUMS USA section. Once there, create a data set by selecting samples from the ‘2022 ACS’ dataset and submit the selection. Next, choose the following harmonized variables for your dataset: (i) STATEICP under GEOGRAPHIC VARIABLES–HOUSEHOLD, (ii) SEX under DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES–PERSON, and (iii) EDUC under EDUCATION VARIABLES–PERSON. After selecting the variables, proceed to view your cart and create the data extract. Change the data format from the default .dat to .csv, then submit the extract. Wait until the status of your data extract changes to ‘completed,’ at which point you can download the data. Upon downloading, a file with the .gz suffix will be received. Decompress this file to obtain the final dataset in .csv format. 2 Estimation
We start by matching STATEICP to the state name and getting the actual value for each
state and replacing NA with 0. Select California’s row from the actual values we get, using
the number of doctoral degrees in the California data as a percentage of total respondents
to get a ratio. Finally, the doctoral degree and the proportion of total respondents obtained
in California are mapped to each state, and the estimated total respondents of each state is
obtained from the doctoral degree of each state. The respondents difference column is obtained
by comparing the value we obtained with the actual value.
3 Explanation of the Difference
There are several reasons why the ratio of people holding a doctoral degree in each state
can vary, such as state education policies or cultural attitudes toward education that lead to
differences in the distribution of educational resources across states. For instance, states with
more universities and research institutions tend to have a higher proportion of residents with
advanced degrees. Therefore, using California’s doctorate-to-respondent ratio as representative
of all states may not be accurate, as it does not account for these regional differences in
education opportunities and demographics.
Additionally, population demographics vary between states. States with more young individuals
may have fewer people with advanced degrees, while states with older populations may
have more. States with industries that require highly educated workers often have more individuals
with advanced degrees, and states with a higher cost of living may also attract more
individuals with advanced degrees due to higher earning potential.

Accurately estimating state-level populations using sample data is a critical task in demographic research, with implications for policymaking, resource allocation, and regional planning. The 2022 American Community Survey (ACS) dataset, accessed via IPUMS USA, provides detailed information on individual respondents, enabling state-by-state analyses of population characteristics. However, estimating total populations across states using ratio-based methods introduces challenges due to varying demographic and educational dynamics across regions.
This paper applies the ratio estimator approach to estimate the total number of respondents in each U.S. state, using California's data as a baseline. The ratio of doctoral degree holders to total respondents in California was used to project total respondent counts for other states. These estimates were then compared to actual respondent numbers, revealing notable discrepancies. These differences stem from variations in state education policies, the distribution of educational resources, population age structures, and the influence of regional industries. For instance, states with a concentration of research institutions or industries requiring advanced education often exhibit higher proportions of doctoral degree holders, while demographic factors such as age and migration patterns further influence these variations.
The findings underscore the limitations of applying uniform ratio estimations across diverse populations and highlight the importance of accounting for regional demographic and economic differences in population estimation. Future studies could refine estimation techniques to better account for such heterogeneity, improving the accuracy and reliability of these methods.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 outlines the process for obtaining and preparing the dataset. Section 3 describes the estimation methodology and the resulting comparisons with actual respondent data. Section 4 explains the observed differences and their underlying causes, while Section 5 concludes with broader implications and potential directions for future research.
